## What is this?

A collection of super-popular Interview questions, along with answers, and some code-snippets that will help you to prepare for technical interviews. Many of these questions are real questions from real interviews. It is by no means comprehensive, and the answers are relatively short ( and for each of the concepts, there are probably better and/or more in depth coverage in the web), but this repo like reference tool, that helps you to prepare for technical interview.
